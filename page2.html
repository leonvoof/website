         Geese are cool because they fly in a “V” shape for a good reason. It can increase their flight distance by as much as 71%.
         When the goose in front gets tired, another goose takes their place.The geese in the back benefit from the airlift from the
          wings of the goose in front of them, which makes the work easier. Therefore, this method is incredibly effective for 
          flying long distances. Also, Geese are extremely social creatures. They tend to get along with other animals without a 
          problem, which makes them ideal for livestock purposes. They always hang around with other geese in the wild too.
