         Geese can be surprisingly aggressive towards humans, especially when defending
         their nests and goslings. Humans hunt millions of wild geese in the United States every year, so you could say
         their mistrust is justified. Geese have evolved to solve conflicts through physical aggression, and unlike other
         birds, they can defend their young against predators.
